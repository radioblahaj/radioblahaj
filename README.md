# ðŸŒˆðŸ¦– Bonjour!
Hi! I'm Arav, and I'm a 17 year old senior from Mississauga, Ontario!

I'm a high schooler who loves building and running online communites, connecting people together, programming (I think that's obvious), and I'm also a really big poltics & urban planning nerd (in training!). I'm hoping to major in a BA in social sciences, and right now Politcal Science is my top choice.

I used to work for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) where I ran community logsticts for all the moving parts that power the community. I also lead the moderation team for the community of 60,000+ teenagers, and helped support other teams such as the newsletter, virtual events, and onboarding. 

 Along the way, I've ran hackathons like [Apocalypse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvCoISXfcE8), **Canada's largest high school hackathon**, worked in VT for 6 weeks running community moderation and virtual events for [Arcade](https://https://hackclub.com/arcade), coordinted workshops & lighting talks at [Epoch](https://epoch.hackclub.com) and [Outernet](Https://outernet.hackclub.com), and a lot of other stuff I can't fit in here.
