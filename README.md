# ðŸŒˆðŸ¦– Bonjour, je m'appelle Arav
I'm a 15 year old junior from a city near Toronto, who loves to code, listen/host podcasts, learn new things, and knows a little french.

Right now I'm building random projects & getting better at programming, working on improvements and maintaining Toriel -- Hack Club's Slack Welcome Bot and helping moderate/keep the  Hack Club Slack a fun & safe place for everyone. Other than programming, I love reading books, biking and discovering new places, learning about urban planning, transportation, climate change, Sound and light (AV stuff) (and the list goes on, and on, and on)

Currently, I'm helping organize workshops & guilds at [Outernet](https://outernet.hackclub.com], Hack Club's summer event

Recently I've organized [AngelHacks Toronto](https://toronto.angelhacks.org), a 12 hour gamejam/hackathon-like event, and [Epoch](https://epoch.hackclub.com), a 42 hour hackathon in New Delhi, India over the winter
