# ðŸŒˆðŸ¦– Bonjour, je m'appelle Arav
Haj! I'm Arav, and I'm a 17 year old senior for Mississauga, Ontario!

I'm a high schooler who loves building and running online communites, connecting people together, programming (I think that's obvious), and I'm also a really big poltics & urban planning nerd (in training!). I'm hoping to major in a BA in social sciences, and right now Politcal Science is my top choice.

I'm working at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), I help run community logsticts for all the moving parts that power the community and oversee all the community teams such as events, support, fraud, onboarding, and moderation. I also run the moderation team for the Hack Club Slack! 


Communites are a big part of my life, and they've made me into the person I am today. I love building and helping shape communites both physically and online. A lot of what I do these days is helping shape and run programs at hack club, making it the best place to be as a teenager interested in computers on the internet. Along the way, I've ran hackathons like [Apocalypse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvCoISXfcE8), **Canada's largest high school hackathon**, worked in VT for 6 weeks running community moderation and virtual events for [Arcade](https://https://hackclub.com/arcade), coordinted workshops & lighting talks at [Epoch](https://epoch.hackclub.com) and [Outernet](Https://outernet.hackclub.com), and a lot of other stuff I can't fit in here.
